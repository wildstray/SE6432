Arduino library for SE6432 dot matrix led displays (eg. Sure Electronics).

This library supports original AVR Arduino as like as Leaflab Maple, ChipKIT Uno32 and maybe other Arduino clones based on ARM Cortex M3 or PIC32.

WARNING: early stage code development - code mostly untested, mostly unoptimized, totally undocumented, all examples are not working (copied from hc1632c, still to be adapted for this library), working only on AVR Arduino and clones.
